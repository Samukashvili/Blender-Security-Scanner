# Blender Security Scanner

A security addon for Blender that detects and prevents malicious Python scripts in blend files. Protects against malware campaigns targeting Blender users through malicious addons and embedded scripts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**This addon provides security improvements but does not guarantee complete protection against all malware.** As an open-source tool, its detection methods are publicly visible and can potentially be bypassed by sophisticated attackers. However, it significantly improves security compared to having no protection and serves as an important first line of defense against common malware patterns.

## Features

### Threat Detection
- **Automatic scanning on file load** - Every blend file is scanned immediately when opened
- Real-time scanning of Python scripts in blend files
- Obfuscation detection for hex, unicode, and character substitution
- Pattern matching for 60+ malicious code signatures
- Multi-severity classification (Critical, High, Medium)
- Configurable auto-scan settings (can be disabled if needed)

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Automatic file load scanning** - Every blend file is scanned upon opening
- Timer blocking prevents auto-execution of malicious timers
- Handler protection blocks suspicious event handler registration
- Quarantine system safely disables malicious code
- Whitelist management for trusted scripts and addons

### Detects Common Threats
- **Subprocess execution** (`subprocess.call`, `os.system`)
- **Code injection** (`exec()`, `eval()`, dynamic imports)
- **Network operations** (requests, urllib, data exfiltration)
- **PowerShell execution** (hidden windows, command injection)
- **Auto-execution** (timers, handlers, persistence mechanisms)
- **Encoding operations** (base64, payload decoding)
- **File operations** (suspicious writes, persistence files)

### Obfuscation Detection
- **Hex encoding**: `\x65\x78\x65\x63` (encoded 'exec')
- **Unicode encoding**: `\u0065\u0078\u0065\x63` (encoded 'exec')
- **Character substitution**: `p0w3rsh3ll` instead of 'powershell'
- **Dynamic access**: `getattr(__builtins__, 'exec')`
- **String concatenation**: `'ex' + 'ec'` obfuscation

## Installation

### Method 1: Download Release
1. Download the latest `blender_security_scanner.py` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open Blender ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Add-ons
3. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded file
4. Enable "System: Blender Security Scanner"

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Copy `blender_security_scanner.py` to your Blender addons directory:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.4\scripts\addons\`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Blender/4.4/scripts/addons/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/blender/4.4/scripts/addons/`
3. Restart Blender and enable the addon in Preferences

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Install and enable the addon
2. **Open any blend file** - The addon automatically scans all Python scripts upon file load
3. **Automatic threat detection** - No manual action required, scanning happens in the background
4. View results in the security panel or threat dialog if threats are detected
5. Take action by quarantining threats or whitelisting safe scripts

### Access Points
- **File Menu**: File ‚Üí Security Scanner
- **3D Viewport**: Press `N` ‚Üí Security tab
- **Text Editor**: Press `N` ‚Üí Security tab
- **Python Console**: `bpy.ops.security.scan_blend_file()`

### Security Panel Features
- **Scan Current File**: Manual security scan
- **Security Status**: Real-time threat overview
- **Whitelist Management**: Manage trusted scripts
- **Tools & Testing**: Debug and configuration options

### Threat Management
- **View Threats**: Detailed threat information with context
- **Show Context**: See 3 lines before/after suspicious code
- **Quarantine**: Safely disable malicious scripts
- **Whitelist**: Mark trusted scripts to skip future scans

## How It Works

### Detection Engine
The security scanner uses regex pattern matching to identify malicious code patterns:

```python
# Example patterns detected:
subprocess.call(['malicious_command'])  # Direct subprocess
e\x78ec('malicious_code')               # Hex obfuscated 'exec'
getattr(__builtins__, 'eval')           # Dynamic function access
bpy.app.timers.register(malicious_func) # Auto-execution
```

### Scanning Process
1. **File Load Detection**: Automatically triggers when any blend file is opened
2. **Script Enumeration**: Finds all Python text blocks in the loaded file
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Scans for malicious signatures using regex patterns
4. **Threat Classification**: Assigns severity levels (Critical, High, Medium)
5. **User Notification**: Displays results immediately if threats are found
6. **Background Protection**: Timer and handler blocking active during session

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Timer Override**: Replaces `bpy.app.timers.register` with secure version
- **Whitelist System**: Allows legitimate Blender functions while blocking suspicious ones
- **Auto-Scan**: Automatically scans files on load (configurable)

## Configuration

### Auto-Scan Settings
- **Automatic scanning on file load** (enabled by default)
- Configure scan sensitivity levels
- Manage whitelist for trusted scripts
- Option to disable auto-scan if needed (not recommended)

### Whitelist Management
- Add scripts to whitelist during threat detection
- Bulk whitelist management interface
- Reason tracking for whitelisted items

## Security Limitations

### Important Disclaimers
- **Not foolproof**: Sophisticated malware may evade detection
- **Open source**: Detection methods are publicly visible
- **False positives**: Legitimate code may trigger alerts
- **No real-time protection**: Only scans when explicitly triggered
- **Python-only**: Does not detect non-Python threats

### Best Practices
- **Keep updated**: Install latest versions for newest threat signatures
- **Verify sources**: Only download blend files from trusted sources
- **Regular scans**: Manually scan files from unknown sources
- **Backup important work**: Maintain clean backups of projects
- **Report issues**: Help improve detection by reporting false positives/negatives

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the included `comprehensive_security_test.py` to verify all detection methods:

```python
# Creates 60+ test threats across all categories
# Safe for testing - no actual malicious code executes
# Tests: subprocess, exec/eval, network, obfuscation, etc.
```

### Expected Results
- **Critical threats**: Timer registration, code execution, subprocess calls
- **High severity**: Network requests, PowerShell execution
- **Medium severity**: File operations, suspicious strings, encoding
- **Obfuscation**: Hex/unicode encoding, character substitution
